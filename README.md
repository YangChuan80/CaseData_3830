## Introduction
### Background and Case Series: 
Implantations of permanent pacemakers in infant patients are difficult compared with the implantations in adult patients. The most common causes of lead failure were the significant increase in pacing threshold and lead breakage. Therefore, it is an urgent need for pediatric patients to select appropriate leads to reduce the failure incidence. The SelectSecure<sup>TM</sup> 3830 lead (Medtronic<sup>TM</sup>, United States) has a small diameter and a reliable long-term sensing and pacing ability, so it can reduce the frequency of lead replacement. Therefore, the 3830 lead is safe and effective for pacing in pediatric patients. We report two infant cases who selected intravenous endocardial implantation with SelectSecure<sup>TM</sup> 3830 pacing lead. They were followed up for 5 years and 1.5 years respectively. The pacing parameters were stable, showing a good curative effect and safety. The 3830 lead is a lumenless active fixed lead, and it is the thinnest pacing lead at present.

### Conclusion: 
In infant patients under two-year-old with high atrioventricular block and bradycardia, the 3830 lead may be considered to be implemented into the right ventricular septum through intravenous endocardium for pacing. The operation process can be applicable, smooth, and manageable. The 3830 pacing lead can be safely and effectively adopted in pediatric patients as they grow up and develop.
